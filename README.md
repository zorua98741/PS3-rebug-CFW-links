# PS3-CFW-rebug-firmware-links
## Rebug.me is dead, and as such i have collected the links for some of their firmwares from the waybackmachine/internet archive
### Do not install these if you do not know what you are doing, i am not responsible if you manage to break/brick/etc your PS3 by installing these firmwares, these links are intended for easy access to people that require rebug firmwares for converting to DEX
