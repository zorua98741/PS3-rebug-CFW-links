# PS3-CFW-rebug-firmware-links

## What is this?
rebug.me has been down for a while, but luckily the internet archive hosts a fair few of the firmwares, 
in the event that [midnight channel](https://archive.midnightchannel.net/SonyPS/Firmware/?cat=rebug) goes down,
this page can be used as a quick way to get the download link to a particular rebug firmware
